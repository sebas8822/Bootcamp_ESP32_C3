# Bootcamp Session

## Bootcamp Structure

### Objective

This bootcamp is designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of IoT development using the ESP32 microcontroller. By the end of this workshop, attendees will have hands-on experience in setting up and programming the ESP32 to control an LED both physically and via the cloud using AWS IoT Core. Participants will learn to:

1. **Understand the Basics of IoT:** Gain a foundational understanding of IoT and explore its practical applications.
2. **Hardware and Software Setup:** Learn to set up the ESP32 development environment and connect hardware components such as LEDs.
3. **Program ESP32:** Write programs using the Arduino IDE to manipulate hardware (e.g., turning on an LED with a button).
4. **Integrate with AWS IoT Core:** Configure and connect the ESP32 to AWS IoT Core to control devices remotely and securely.
5. **Develop Practical IoT Skills:** Through building a small IoT project, develop the skills needed for larger-scale IoT development.
